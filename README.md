# Javascript-Snake-Game 1

I Developed an Real time Snake game using mainly ES6 javascript
I named it pas pas cause, that's how they sound, I huess

> so first when I created this game, it only has the "Snake and the food"
> using ES6 javascript I added some rule movement of snake to how many
> levels his body will grow when it eats the food also rules like when
> the snake eats itself or the snake got collide into the boundary walls
> the game will end and some internal css like I uesd grid layout to create
> the game area and the snake body and the food location.

After some time the game feels so normal and boring cause it don't have a
UI so I opened an issue then someone named @skippyr on github forked my
repo in a new branch and make the neccessary changes like the 'how to play
and the current score and the highest score also when we lose the game a
prompt box appears with a option try again'. The UI also looks somewhat
nice.

I really appreciate @skippyr 's contribution.
